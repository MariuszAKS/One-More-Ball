# One More Ball

A game made for [PirateSoftware GameJam 17](https://itch.io/jam/pirate) hosted by [PirateSoftware](https://piratesoftware.itch.io/)

**Theme:** Only One

**Idea:** You needed money. You come across a merchant that offers you a game. For undisclosed price. If you win, you don't loose anything and get the money. Only if you loose, you will have to worry about the initial price. Because you are desperate, you agree. Good luck!

**Use of Theme:** You are allowed to play for more money. If you want, you do so telling yourself: *"Only one more game"*
